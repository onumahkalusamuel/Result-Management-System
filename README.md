# Result Management System (RMS)

RMS is a Result Computation platform that can be applied to any school setup. It was written in PHP, optimized for view on a computer system, and would require good knowledge of the particular school examination system for effective configuration. A link to a video series showing how to deploy it for a secondary school will be added later...

## Contributing

The system is far from complete. Automatic setup for certain schools could be added to make the process stresfree.
